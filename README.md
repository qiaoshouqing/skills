A curated collection of agent skills designed to enhance productivity and automate common development workflows.

## What are Agent Skills?

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) are an open standard for giving AI agents reusable capabilities. Skills follow the `SKILL.md` specification and work across multiple AI coding tools:

**Supported Agents:**

Claude Code · OpenAI Codex · Gemini CLI · Cursor · VS Code · Amp · TRAE · Roo Code · Goose · and more

Skills are invoked using the `/` prefix (e.g., `/env-sync`) and provide specialized functionality for specific tasks.

### Key Features

- **Open Standard**: Works across all agents that support the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) specification
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Skills load only what's needed, keeping context efficient
- **Auto-Discovery**: Place skills in your agent's skills directory and they're automatically available
- **Extensible**: Easy to create custom skills for your specific workflows

## Available Skills

### 🔄 env-sync

Syncs `.env` files from git root repository to git worktrees with security built-in.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
/env-sync
# or simply ask:
# "sync env" / "copy env" / "同步 env"
```

**Features:**
- 🔒 Security First: Never displays `.env` contents, always asks before overwriting
- 🎯 Auto-Detection: Automatically detects git worktrees and validates paths
- 🌍 Multilingual: Supports English and Chinese trigger phrases

## 📦 Installation

### One-Command Install (Recommended)

Install all skills with a single command using the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) ecosystem. It auto-detects your installed agents and places skills in the correct directories:

```bash
npx skills add qiaoshouqing/Skills
```

Install a single skill:

```bash
npx skills add qiaoshouqing/Skills --skill env-sync
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual control (example for Claude Code):

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:qiaoshouqing/Skills.git ~/claude-skills

# Install all skills via symlinks
cd ~/claude-skills
for skill in */SKILL.md; do
  skill_name=$(dirname "$skill")
  ln -sf "$(pwd)/$skill_name" ~/.claude/skills/
done
```

Install a single skill:

```bash
ln -sf ~/claude-skills/env-sync ~/.claude/skills/env-sync
```

> **Note:** Different agents use different skill directories. `npx skills add` handles this automatically. For manual installation to other agents, refer to their documentation.

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Start Claude Code and test
cc
> /env-sync --help
```

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Where are skills stored?</strong></summary>

Skills are stored in `~/.claude/skills/` by default. Each skill is a directory containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I trigger a skill?</strong></summary>

Skills can be triggered in multiple ways:
1. Using the `/` prefix: `/skill-name`
2. Natural language: "sync env", "copy env"
3. Auto-trigger: Some skills activate automatically (e.g., when .env is missing)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I modify existing skills?</strong></summary>

Yes! If you used symlinks during installation:
1. Edit the skill in `~/claude-skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
2. Changes are immediately available (no restart needed)
3. Commit and contribute back via pull request
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do skills differ from commands?</strong></summary>

- **Skills**: Reusable prompts/workflows loaded into Claude's context
